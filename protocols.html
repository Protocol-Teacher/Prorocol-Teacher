        <p class="para text-white">
            Ethernet II frame is a basic data unit that is transported in the physical layer of the OSI model. 
          <br>
          It includes the following header fields:
          <br>
          <br>
          - Preamble: Preamble helps with synchronization between both the sender and receiver.
          <br>
          <br>
          -	Destination Address: The MAC address of the receiving node.
          <br>
          <br>
          - Source Address: The MAC address of the sending node.
          <br>
          <br>
          -	Type: Includes the type of packet in its data field.
          <br>
          Type Codes: 
          <br>
          IPv4  080016  
          <br>
          IPv6  86DD16  
          <br>
          <br>
          -	Payload (Body): A maximum payload of 1500 octets.
          <br>
          <br>

        </p>
      <br><br>
        <h1 class="left text-uppercase text-white">IPv4</h1>
        <p class="para text-white">
            IPv4 is the most used internet protocol, it is a connectionless protocol, it does not guarantee delivery, nor data integrity. It uses an IPv4 address space of 31 bits, which is not enough to give each node a unique address, this problem is solved by using the later version IPv6 which uses an address space of 128 bits.
            <br>
            It includes the following header fields:
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Version: This includes a four-bit version field, it is always set to 4
            <br>
            <br>
            -	HLen: Internet Header Length includes the size of the header in four bits.
            <br>
            <br>
            -	TOS: 
            The Type of Service is used to request a low delay route and priority.            
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Length: 
            This includes the size of the packet including the header. Maximum size is 65,535 bytes and minimum size is 20 bytes.         
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Ident: 
            This identifies the fragments of an IP datagram.          
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Flags: 
            This is used to identify fragments. If the second bit is set then the packet will not be fragmented, and it will be dropped if it can not be routed without fragmentation. If the third bit is set then more fragments are expected, if not set then it will be the last fragment.      
            <br>      
            bit 0: Reserved; must be zero.
            <br>
            bit 1: Don't Fragment
            <br>
            bit 2: More Fragments
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Offset: 
            This is used to place the fragmented packet in the correct position within the entire unfragmented packet. The value is multiplied by 8 which gives the maximum size of 212 Ã— 8 = 65,528 bytes.
            <br>
            <br>
            -	TTL: 
            Time to Live helps prevent packets from circling the internet indefinitely. It also helps with counting hops since every time a packet reaches a router the TTL is decreased until it reaches zero then the packet gets dropped.
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Protocol: 
            This includes the protocol carried in the data section of the IPv4 packet.

            Checksum is used for error checking.

            Includes the IPv4 address of the source node.
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>
            <br>
            -	Options (variable): 
            This field is not usually used.
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Pad (variable): 
            This is used to ensure that the packet length is a multiple of 32 bits.            
            <br>
            <br>
            -	Payload: 
            This includes the data carried in the IPv4 packet.

        <h1 class="left text-uppercase text-white">IPv6</h1>
        <p class="para text-white">
            IPv6 was introduced to solve problems with IPv4. The main problem is the number of addresses available, IPv6 has an address space of 128 bits, this means it can support an astronomical number of devices (340 undecillion). It also provides other technical benefits. 
            <br>
            It includes the following header fields:

            <br>
            -	FlowLabel:

            <br>
            -	HopeLimit: 
            Hope Limit prevent packets from circling the internet indefinitely. It also helps with counting hops since every time a packet reaches a router the HopeLimit is decreased until it reaches zero then the packet gets dropped.

            <br>
            -	SourceAddress:

            The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is an error checking protocol. It helps devices report errors to each other through a network. For example, it can be used to report that a host or a router cannot be reached.
